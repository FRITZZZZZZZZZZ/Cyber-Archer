This File describes a advanced aiming system for use in compound bows. It's core functionality is the marking of the impact location of the bows arrow by means of a laser dot. 
Since the exact angle of the laser is knowen, a camera can estimate its distance from the laser by locating it in its field of view. The System supports compensation for bow tilt and bow pitch.
Another aspect of this system is its capibility to odometrically track points in the cameras field of view and lose the bow at the exact time it is positions correctly in order to hit the previously marked
point.
